# AUTOAI-IDS
An Automated Model Selection Approach for Network Intrusion Detection Tasks

Purdue University Indianapolis, Indiana, United States of America. 

We propose a scalable and efficient solution to the problem of model selection
in network intrusion detection tasks to face evolving cybersecurity threats.

We present a meta-learning framework that can be extended to other
domains and datasets, facilitating the rapid deployment of optimal models
in the dynamic network intrusion detection tasks
